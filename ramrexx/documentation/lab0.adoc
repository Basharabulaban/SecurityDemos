== Lab 0: Setup steps

. Re-check Authentication Status of Red Hat Virtualization provider
You will need to have CloudForms re-check the authentication status of the Red Hat Virtualization provider. This will make sure that CloudForms is re-synchronizing with the Red Hat Virtualization provider.

* Open up your web browser and log into *https://cfme-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com*. The *<GUID>* portion is a 4 character random string that will be assigned to you.
* Accept the SSL warnings.
* Login as admin with password r3dh4t1!.
* On the left menus, navigate to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*.
