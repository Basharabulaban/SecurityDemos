== Overview and Prerequisites:
In this hands-on lab and demo environment, you will learn how to automate security and compliance using a combination of Red Hat CloudForms, Red Hat Satellite, OpenSCAP, Red Hat Insights, and Red Hat Ansible Automation. Specifically, you will go through a series of exercises that will show you how, from a central place, you can: create a security compliant host at provisioning time, create and enforce control policies, automate security scans and remediations for various different security profiles and security controls, and do proactive security and automated risk management. The goal of this lab is to introduce you to a variety of Red Hat products that can help you with proactive security and compliance automation. We will demonstrate the power and flexibility of using either one or a combination of Red Hat products to help you with security and compliance automation.

This lab is geared towards systems administrators, cloud administrators and operators, architects, and others working on infrastructure operations management who are interested in learning how to automate security compliance across their heterogeneous infrastructure using one or more Red Hat Products.  The prerequisite for this lab include basic Linux skills gained from Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) or equivalent system administration skills. Knowledge of virtualization and basic linux scripting would also be helpful, but not required.

== Attendees, during this session, will learn:
* What Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is and how you can use it to automate compliance with security policies
* How to provision a security compliant host using both Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Ansible Automation
* How to use Red Hat Satellite and Red Hat CloudForms to automatically apply and enforce security policies
* How to prevent severity high vulnerable container images from running in Red Hat Openshift Container Platform using Red Hat CloudForms
* How to use OpenSCAP, Red Hat Satellite and Red Hat CloudForms to scan and audit systems for security compliance
* How to use OpenSCAP, Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Ansible Automation to automatically remediate systems that are out of compliance
* How to create and view reports showing compliant and non-compliant VMs in Red Hat CloudForms after running OpenSCAP security compliance scans on these VMs
* How to create and view security related reports for a hybrid environment, including: Red Hat Virtualization, Red Hat Openstack Platform, Amazom AWS, and Red Hat Openshift Container Platform.
* How to use Red Hat Insights for pro-active security and automated risk management

== Lab Environment:
Your entire lab environment is hosted online and includes: Red Hat Virtualization, Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat CloudForms, Red Hat Ansible Automation, Red Hat Insights, Red Hat Openshift Container Platform, and a workstation system which will have a public IP you can SSH into. You can get to all the listed Red Hat products and all your VMs from the workstation system.

You will each be given your own unique *GUID*, which you will use to access your own instance of these Red Hat products for your lab exercises.
