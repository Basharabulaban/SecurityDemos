= Lab 3: How to use Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) to securely decrypt LUKs encrypted volumes

== Goal of Lab
The goal of this lab is to use Cockpit and cockpit-storaged to understand how to use Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) to securely decrypt LUKs encrypted volumes. You will install the Tang server on our NBDE1 server, and install the Clevis client as dependency for cockpit-storaged on NBDE2.

== Introduction
Network-Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) allows the user to encrypt root volumes of hard drives on physical and virtual machines without requiring to manually enter a password when systems are restarted.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux implements NBDE with a central server named Tang, and and client framework named Clevis.

Tang is used to bind data to a secure network.  It is stateless and does not require TLS or authentication.  Tang does not interact with client keys, so it never obtains identifying information from the client.  Clevis provides automated unlocking of LUKS volumes.

Clevis and Tang are generic client and server components that provide network bound encryption. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, they are used in conjunction with LUKS to encrypt and decrypt root and non-root storage volumes to accomplish Network Bound Disk Encryption.

Cockpit & cockpit-storaged are providing a user interface in browser for managing hard drives and NBDE.

== Lab 3.1 Installing the Tang server
. Navigate to the Lab information page from *Lab 0 Setup steps*. This page has your environment's power control and consoles. Click on the console for *NBDE1*. Login to the NBDE1 server as *root* using the password *r3dh4t1!*.

+

. Then, install the tang packages
+
[source, text]
[root@nbde1 ~]# yum install tang
+

NOTE:
If you wanted to copy and paste text to send to the console, you could also press the *T* button at the top right of your console if you didn't want to type text into the console directly. This is mainly recommended for longer commands.

. Finally, enable the tang service in systemd and open the HTTP port in firewall:
+
[source, text]
[root@nbde1 ~]# systemctl enable tangd.socket --now
[root@nbde1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-service=http
[root@nbde1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent

Since tangd uses the systemd socket activation mechanism, the server starts as soon as the first connection comes in. A new set of cryptographic keys is automatically generated at the first start.

== Lab 3.2 Installing the cockpit-storaged

Your NBDE2 server is already encrypted and this exercise will install the client packages that will allow you to un-encrypt the root device drive upon boot without manual intervention.

Navigate to the Lab information page from *Lab 0 Setup steps*. This page has your environment's power control and consoles. Click on the console for *NBDE2*. The passphrase for the LUKs encrypted disk on *NBDE2* is *r3dh4t1!*. You will need to enter the pass phrase to complete the boot process.  If you wanted to copy and paste text to send to the console, press the *T* button at the top right of your console.

Then, install the cockpit-storaged package:

[source, text]
[root@nbde2 ~]# yum install cockpit-storaged

Then, enable Cockpit:

[source, text]
[root@nbde2 ~]# systemctl start cockpit.socket
[root@nbde2 ~]# systemctl enable cockpit.socket --now

== Lab 3.3 Initializing the luks binding to the tang server using Cockpit

Next, we will initialize the luks binding to the tang server using Cockpit.

Open https://nbde2.example.com:9090/

Login as root user

Next, access *Storage* menu.

Click on drive when you access the menu:

image:images/nbde_cockpit_drive.png[]

Open *Encryption* tab.

image:images/nbde_cockpit_encryption tab.png[]

You should see existing Passphrase key, because the drive is encrypted using password.

image:images/nbde_cockpit_keys.png[]

Click on *+* button to add one more key. You will see modal window looking like this:

image:images/nbde_cockpit_tang_empty.png[]

As a Keyserver address we will use *nbde1.example.com* and *r3dh4t1!* for existing disk passphrase. So, fill the modal window fields like this and click *Add* button:

image:images/nbde_cockpit_tang_filled.png[]

It will take some take for it to process the request. After this click *Trust key*:

image:images/nbde_cockpit_tang_confirm.png[]

After this you will see both Disk passphrase and Keyserver as your keys for the disk:

image:images/nbde_cockpit_keys_result.png[]

This disk can now be unlocked with your existing passphrase as well as with the Clevis policy.

== Lab 3.4 Enable Decryption on the Boot Process
. To enable the early boot system to process the disk binding, enter the following command on *NBDE2*.
+
[source, text]
[root@nbde2 ~]# dracut -f
+
NOTE: Pass the *-vf* parameter if you want to see verbose output.

== Lab 3.5 Reboot *NBDE2* and test that NBDE was successfully configured
. Reboot *NBDE2*.  When the prompt comes up for the LUKs passphrase, wait a few seconds and *NBDE2*  should automatically begin the boot process without requiring you to enter a password.

+
[source, text]
[root@nbde2 ~]# reboot
