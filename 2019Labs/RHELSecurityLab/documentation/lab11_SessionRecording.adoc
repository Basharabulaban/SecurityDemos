= Lab 11: Session Recording

== Goal of Lab
The goal of this lab is to use Session Recording to help log and audit users terminal sessions and correlate them with system logs.

* You will need to install required software. Required packages are tlog & cockpit-session-recording.
* You will configure your it to record terminal activity for specific users
* You will wear a hat of third-party contractor who will break something on your system
* You will wear a hat of a system administrator to find what happened to your system

== Introduction
Terminal Session Recording project aims to log users terminal sessions for purposes of audit, security and monitoring. It provides interface in Cockpit to analyze these recordings and correlate them with system logs. This provides a whole picture of activity which was done.

=== tlog
Tlog records terminal activity by putting itself in the middle between user and terminal. In our lab tlog stores data in systemd journal.

=== cockpit-session-recording
Our package for Cockpit uses provided APIs to access journal and get session from it. It provides JavaScript based player which produces text output, but with a videoplayer-like controls.

== Accessing the Session Recording Lab System

All of the exercises in this lab are run on the _sessionrecording.example.com_ host. You will switch between various user to imitate different behaviours. Each set of exercises instructs you about which user to use, and the username is reflected in the command prompt, as seen in the examples below:

 * The *root* user prompt on _sessionrecording.example.com_

    [root@sessionrecording]#

 * The *q* user prompt on _sessionrecording.example.com_

    [q@sessionrecording]$

 * The *jbond* user prompt on _sessionrecording.example.com_

    [jbond@sessionrecording]$

The recommended way to access the _sessionrecording.example.com_ is to open up the terminal and SSH into the
_sessionrecording.example.com_ host from the bastion workstation system as shown below.  If done
correctly, you should not need to enter a password.

	[localhost]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
	[lab-user@workstation-GUID]$ ssh root@sessionrecording.example.com


== Install packages

    [root@sessionrecording]# yum install tlog

    [root@sessionrecording]# yum install cockpit-session-recording


== Enable Cockpit

    [root@sessionrecording]# systemctl start cockpit.socket

    [root@sessionrecording]# systemctl enable cockpit.socket --now


== Setup recording

== Review tlog configuration

Open https://sessionrecording.example.com:9090/

Login as root user

Click on Session Recording menu item

image:images/session_recording_menu.png[]

Then click on the button with cog icon to access the configuration.

image:images/session_recording_config.png[]

Take a look on the configuration of tlog-rec-session.conf which is represented as "General Configuration" in Cockpit

image:images/session_recording_tlog_conf.png[]

Enable logging of user's input by clicking the corresponding checkbox:

image:images/session_recording_tlog_conf_1.png[]

Then, press "Save" button.

===== PREFERED:  Setup recorded users using cockpit-session-recording

While staying on the same page as in previous chapter do the following.

Choose "Some" option in Scope dropdown and put "q" in the Users input. Then click the save button.

image:images/session_recording_sssd.png[]

That is it. Now the q user will be recorded.

===== OPTIONAL: Setup recorded users using terminal

*If you used preferred method using cockpit-session-recording then you don't need to do this step, because it will produce the same result.*

Open sssd session recording configuration file using vi editor

    [root@sessionrecording]# vi /etc/sssd/conf.d/sssd-session-recording.conf

*If something goes wrong* hit *Esc* key several times and then type *:q!* and press *Enter*. This will cause vi to exit without saving changes to the file.

Press *i* to enter in edit mode in vi. Change the line

    scope=none

to

    scope=some

Then change the line

    users=

to

    users=q

Press *Esc* to exit edit mode and then type *:wq!* and press *Enter* to save file and exit from vi. After this do

    [root@essionrecording]# cat /etc/sssd/conf.d/sssd-session-recording.conf

You should see this as an output:

    [session_recording]
    scope=some
    users=q
    groups=

Then you need to restart SSSD, so that changes will take place:

    [root@essionrecording]# systemctl restart sssd

===== One more way to enable recording by changing user's shell and avoiding usage of SSSD

In this case user will have to change user's shell to tlog-rec-session, so that their working shell will be the one that is listed in the tlog-rec-session.conf configuration file ( /bin/bash by default ).

    [root@essionrecording]# yum install util-linux-user

Then

    [root@essionrecording]# chsh jbond

And input */usr/bin/tlog-rec-session*

    Changing shell for jbond.
    New shell [/bin/bash]
    /usr/bin/tlog-rec-session
    chsh: Warning: "/usr/bin/tlog-rec-session" is not listed in /etc/shells.
    Shell changed.

This will make user to be recorded on next login.

== In practise

Let's create some activity by one of the recorded users. Then you will be able to play it back in Cockpit.

Login using SSH to the same machine:

    [root@sessionrecording]# ssh q@sessionrecording.example.com

You will see notice message in terminal right after login

image:images/session_recording_notice.png[]

Let's install some software for the lab case.

    [q@sessionrecording]$ sudo yum install mc nginx

Remember, that this session is being recorded. You could try to resize session window to see it's supported later.

    [q@sessionrecording]$ mc

You will see mc launched

image:images/session_recording_mc.png[]

Try to use by navigating to various directories. Then click on Quit button in the right bottom corner.

Let's imitate some real world scenario by breaking nginx web server configuration file, so that later we will be able to investigate the problem using session recording in cockpit.

    [q@sessionrecording]$ sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

image:images/session_recording_nginx.png[]

Let's remove *;* in line *worker_connections 1024;* like this:

image:images/session_recording_nginx_broken.png[]

In next step we need to restart nginx server:

    [q@sessionrecording]$ sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Restart will fail, because of the error we created in nginx.conf file, but this time this is exactly what we need as an example.
You will see error message like this:

image:images/session_recording_nginx_error.png[]

Now, it is time to login to cockpit and use cockpit-session-recording to investigate why web server does not work.

//TODO add login to cockpit section

In session player action of restarting cockpit should look something like this:

image:images/session_recording_cockpit_nginx_restart.png[]

In the bottom part of the page correlated logs are shown. You should be able to find corresponding messages:

image:images/session_recording_cockpit_nginx_error.png[]

Clicking on time of event in logs panel will trigger player to jump to same time in the session.

You can try searching for "nginx.conf" to find time when the config was edited. Closest time will be shown and by clicking on it player will rewind position to it.
