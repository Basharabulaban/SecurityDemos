== Lab 0: Setup steps

=== Accessing your dedicated lab environment using your provided GUID

. Go https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_tester[here^] in order to obtain your lab GUID.
This GUID will be used to access your unique lab environment.
. Find the lab `Automate Your Security by Creating Custom Security Content`.
The activation key is *security*.
. The next page will present you with
- your GUID string,
- link to the lab instructions, and
- the last item of the bullet list - link to *power control and consoles*
. Click the `here` link to go to the "environment's power control and consoles" page.
You should get to a new page - a list of VMs.
There is only one VM, so click the only `CONSOLE` link on the page.
. You are now redirected to a remote desktop interface.
Log in as `lab-user` using the password `r3dh4t1!`.
You are all set!
