== Lab exercise 0: Setup steps

=== Accessing your dedicated lab environment using your provided GUID

. On your Red Hat Summit provided laptop, notice that the https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_summit[*Lab GUID Assignment page*^] is already loaded onto your Firefox web browser.
From this page, you will be assigned your unique GUID, which you will use to access your unique lab environment and systems.

. Select the proper *Lab Code* from the drop down list. Find the lab `T9A495 - Creating customized security policy content to automate security compliance`.
The activation key is *security*.

. The resulting *Lab Information page* will display your lab's GUID and other useful information about your lab environment. Take note of your assigned GUID. You will use this GUID to access your lab's environment and systems.  Your unique GUID will also be embedded in your lab environment's host names. From this *Lab Information page*, you will also be able to access your unique lab environment's power control and consoles. Go to the last bullet point and click on *here* to access the environment's power control and consoles.
