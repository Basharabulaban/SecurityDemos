= Lab exercise 5: The Art of OVAL Checks

:experimental:
:imagesdir: images


== What you will learn

* ... what is the OVAL about.
* ... how `ComplianceAsCode` facilitates creation of new OVAL content.
* ... how to test OVAL checks.
* ... how to use tests and remediations to safely and gradually improve an OVAL check.


== What we have done for you

* We have cloned the `ComplianceAsCode` repository to the `content` directory.
* We have installed dependencies that are required for the content build using `yum install`:
** generic build utilities: `cmake`, `make`,
** utilities for generating SCAP content: `openscap-utils`, and finally
** python dependencies for putting content together: `python3-pyyaml`, `python3-jinja2`.

* We have set up a `podman` `ssg_test_suite` image by building one using the `Dockerfiles/test_suite-rhel` files.
`root` 's  SSH keys are authorized by the container's root user.
The steps how to accomplish this are in the `tests/README.md` file of the `ComplianceAsCode` project.
* We have modified the OVAL check for the `accounts_tmout`, so we can improve it.


== Hands-on


=== Lab 5.1 Before you start

Log in to the VM using the text console if you haven't done so already.
Open the terminal window on the lab laptop.
Execute the following command,
but don't forget to replace `GUID` with your lab provided GUID:

----
[... ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$
----

For best experience, open a second terminal window on the laptop:
Click `Activities`, then right click on the Terminal icon and choose `New Window` to open one more terminal window.
Repeat the procedure, so you connect to the VM in that terminal window as well:

----
[... ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$
----


=== Lab 5.2 OVAL introduction

OVAL stands for Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language.
In a nutshell, it is an XML-based declarative language that is part of the SCAP standard.
We will focus on its ability to query and evaluate state of a system.
Quoting from the http://ovalproject.github.io/getting-started/faqs/[OVAL FAQ]:

__
The language standardizes the three main steps of the assessment process: representing configuration information of systems for testing; analyzing the system for the presence of the specified machine state (vulnerability, configuration, patch state, etc.); and reporting the results of this assessment.
__

The `ComplianceAsCode` project supports OVAL as the language for writing automated configurable check.
It compiles OVAL snippets into checks that are understood by OVAL interpreters - for example the OpenSCAP scanner.
The scanner evaluates the check, and determines whether the system passes.

In this lab exercise, we will go through the OVAL snippet of the `accounts_tmout` rule.
We will see how even simple checks can get complicated soon, and what can we do about it.
Finally, we will discover that the check has been written incorrectly, and we will fix it.


=== Lab 5.3 Anatomy of an existing check-remediation pair

Select one of your terminals, go to the lab directory and build the content:

----
[... ~]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval
[... lab5_oval]$ ./build_product rhel8
----

When the build finishes, we will take a look at the RHEL8 OSPP profile.
Open the file explorer, and open the guide in the browser:

Click on `Activites` at the top left of your desktop and click on the file cabinet icon to open the file explorer.

image::desktopfilefolder.png[100,100]

Just to make sure, click the `Home` icon in the left upper part of the file explorer window.
Then, navigate to the location of the exercise by double-clicking on the `labs` folder, followed by double-clicking the
`lab5_oval`, `build` and the `guides` directories.
Finally, double-click the `ssg-rhel8-guide-ospp.html` file.

In this lab exercise, we will focus on the `accounts_tmout` rule.
In order to find the rule entry it in the guide, press `Ctrl+F` or use the `Edit->Find in this page` menu item, and search for the `Set Interactive Session Timeout` string, which is the rule title.

The description says:

----

Setting the TMOUT option in /etc/profile ensures that all user sessions
will terminate based on inactivity. The TMOUT setting in /etc/profile
should read as follows:

TMOUT=600

----

When dealing with the rule check, there are additional aspects to have in mind:

- As the timeout is supposed to be set to 600 seconds, what is the consequence if the timeout value is set to 100?
Is it more or less secure?
+
Having shorter time interval between inactivity and logout is more bothersome for the user, but it is a stricter requirement.
Therefore, we would like to make sure that if the rule requires `TMOUT=600`, having `TMOUT=100` is also evaluated as correct.

- The rule description of having the `TMOUT=...` statement in a config file is accurate, but guides on the Internet often recommend to have `export TMOUT=...` there.
The assignment form with the `export` keyword ensures that the variable is available to other programs.
Environmental variables s.a. `PATH` and `HOME` are commonly exported, so this probably is where the confusion that `export` is needed for `TMOUT` to work comes from.
+
We want to make sure that the rule's check will allow both forms - with and without `export`, although the `export` keyword is not required.


==== Lab 5.3.1 Bash remediation

Let's examine the bash remediation - open the respective file in the text editor:

----
[... lab5_oval]$ nano linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout/bash/shared.sh
----

The remediation body looks like this:

NOTE: The header of the remediation is processed by the build system, so the actual file contents and the remediation displayed in the HTML guide differ.

[source,bash]
----
if grep --silent ^TMOUT /etc/profile ; then
        sed -i "s/^TMOUT.*/TMOUT=$var_accounts_tmout/g" /etc/profile
else
        echo -e "\n# Set TMOUT to $var_accounts_tmout per security requirements" >> /etc/profile
        echo "TMOUT=$var_accounts_tmout" >> /etc/profile
fi
----

You don't need to make any changes to the file.
After you are finished with looking, press `Ctrl+x` to bring up the "save and exit" option.
If you are asked about saving any changes, you probably don't want that, in which case press `n`.

We can see that the remediation is in sync with the description - it handles the `/etc/profile` file, and it either

- adds the `TMOUT` assignment to the file if is missing, or it
- modifies the `TMOUT` assignment, so that the correct value is used if an assignment already exists.


==== Lab 5.3.2 OVAL check

Let's move on to the OVAL check:

Open the file that defines the check in the text editor:

----
[... lab5_oval]$ nano linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout/oval/shared.xml
----

That file is much more complicated, so let's examine it piece by piece:

We have the leading `definition` element:

[source,xml]
----

  <definition class="compliance" id="accounts_tmout" version="2">
    <metadata>
      <title>Set Interactive Session Timeout</title>
      <affected family="unix">
        <platform>multi_platform_rhel</platform>
        <platform>multi_platform_fedora</platform>
        <platform>multi_platform_ol</platform>
      </affected>
      <description>Checks interactive shell timeout</description>
    </metadata>
    <criteria operator="OR">
      <criterion comment="TMOUT value in /etc/profile >= var_accounts_tmout" test_ref="test_etc_profile_tmout" />
      <criterion comment="TMOUT value in /etc/profile.d/*.sh >= var_accounts_tmout" test_ref="test_etc_profiled_tmout" />
    </criteria>
  </definition>
  ...
----

The `definition` specifies a `criteria` element.
Here is a close-up of those critera:

[source,xml]
----
    ...
    <criteria operator="OR">
      <criterion comment="TMOUT value in /etc/profile >= var_accounts_tmout"
        test_ref="test_etc_profile_tmout" />
      <criterion comment="TMOUT value in /etc/profile.d/*.sh >= var_accounts_tmout"
        test_ref="test_etc_profiled_tmout" />
    </criteria>
  </definition>
  ...
----

We can see that each criterion references a test.
The first test checks for `TMOUT` setting in the `/etc/profile` file, the other one checks all files in `/etc/profile.d/` that have the `sh` file extension.
If either of those tests passes, the whole test passes as well, as the `operator="OR"` attribute of the `criteria` element imposes.

A test is typically composed of an object and state definitions.
The object defines what should be gathered on the tested system, the state defines expected properties of the object.
In order for the test to pass, the object has to exist, and it has to conform to the specified state.

We will now examine the test for the `/etc/profile` criterion and it's dependencies:

[source,xml]
----
  ...
  <ind:textfilecontent54_test check="all" check_existence="all_exist"
      comment="TMOUT in /etc/profile" id="test_etc_profile_tmout" version="1">
    <ind:object object_ref="object_etc_profile_tmout" />
    <ind:state state_ref="state_etc_profile_tmout" />
  </ind:textfilecontent54_test>
  ...
----

The object definition associates a filename with a regular expression.
The filename is checked for the regular expression, and if there is a match, contents of the regular expression group become the object.
The `instance` element that equals 1 tells us that it is the first match of the regular expression what defines the object.

[source,xml]
----
  ...
  <ind:textfilecontent54_object id="object_etc_profile_tmout" version="1">
    <ind:filepath>/etc/profile</ind:filepath>
    <ind:pattern operation="pattern match">^[\s]*TMOUT[\s]*=[\s]*(.*)[\s]*$</ind:pattern>
    <ind:instance datatype="int">1</ind:instance>
  </ind:textfilecontent54_object>
----

The state is a specification that the object (i.e. the matched substring) should be an integer that equals to the value of a variable `var_accounts_tmout`.

[source,xml]
----
  <ind:textfilecontent54_state id="state_etc_profile_tmout" version="1">
    <ind:subexpression datatype="int" operation="equals" var_check="all" var_ref="var_accounts_tmout" />
  </ind:textfilecontent54_state>

  <external_variable comment="external variable for TMOUT" datatype="int"
      id="var_accounts_tmout" version="1" />
  ...
----

There are two regular expression that check for `TMOUT=...` in the `shared.xml` file, one for the `profile` test, and one for the `profile.d/\*.sh` test.
As there are two types of locations that need to be examined (the single `/etc/profile` file and `*.sh` files in the `/etc/profile.d` directory), there have to be two objects.
The `object_etc_profile_tmout` and `object_etc_profiled_tmout` objects have different file / path specifications, but the regular expression is the same.
The alternative form of the assignment `export TMOUT=...` isn't handled in either of them.

Moreover, there is the `equals` operation used to perform the match.
As stated in the previous section, this looks wrong, as shorter timeouts are more secure, and therefore should be allowed.

Now you can close the file.
As a reminder, you don't need to make any changes at this point.
Therefore, press `Ctrl+x` to bring up the "save and exit" option.
If you are asked about saving any changes, you probably don't want that, in which case press `n`.


== Lab 5.4 Tests introduction

The `ComplianceAsCode` project features a test suite that is very useful to define what scenarios the check and the remediation are supposed to handle.
It sets up a system to a certain state, and runs the scan and possibly remediations.
Results are reported in form of console output, and detailed reports are saved to a log directory.

Regarding scenarios, consider for example the `accounts_tmout` rule - the two simplest cases are handled using the following scenarios:

* `TMOUT=600` is present in `/etc/profile` - this test scenario should pass.
* `TMOUT=600` is not present in `/etc/profile` or `/etc/profile.d/*.sh` - it gets more complicated, because remediations become involved:
** This test scenario should fail the initial scan.
** If there is a remediation for the rule, it should apply without errors.
** The final scan after the remediation should pass.

The test suite has to prepare a system, scan it, and report results.
Due to practical considerations, the system under test should be isolated from the system running the test.
The test suite support `libvirt` VMs, and `docker` or `podman` containers that satisfy this isolation requirement.
In this exercise, we are going to use a `podman` container with the RHEL7 image.


== Lab 5.5 Tests Hands-on

To produce the RHEL7 content that we need to test RHEL7 image, we need to build it:

----
[... lab5_oval]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval
[... lab5_oval]$ ./build_product rhel7
----

We will test the `accounts_tmout` rule included in the `ospp` profile of the RHEL7 datastream.
We have to run the test suite as a superuser, as it involves spinning up a container that exposes an SSH port.
Then, we execute the test suite:

----
[... lab5_oval]$ sudo python3 tests/test_suite.py rule --container ssg_test_suite --datastream build/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml accounts_tmout
INFO - The DataStream contains 2 Benchmarks
INFO - 0 - scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-rhel7-xccdf-1.2.xml
INFO - 1 - scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-rhel7-pcidss-xccdf-1.2.xml
INFO - Selected Benchmark is 0
INFO - To select a different Benchmark, use --xccdf-id-number option.
INFO - The base image option has been specified, choosing Podman-based test environment.
INFO - Logging into /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval/logs/...
INFO - xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_accounts_tmout
INFO - Script comment.fail.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
INFO - Script line_not_there.fail.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
INFO - Script correct_value.pass.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
INFO - Script wrong_value.fail.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
----

[NOTE]
====
The test suite is a Python script `tests/test_suite.py`.
We have supplied following arguments to it:

* We want to use the test suite in `rule` mode - we want to test a rule under all available rule test scenarios.
+
The alternative mode is `profile` mode, which is simpler - there are no test scenarios, the system is scanned.

* We want to use `podman` with the `ssg_test_suite` image as the backend, so we supply the `--container ssg_test_suite` arguments.

* Of course, we have to specify what datastream to use for testing - we will use the built one, so we specify `--datastream build/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml` arguments.

* Finally, we specify what to test - a rule regular expression, i.e. `accounts_tmout` or `^accounts_tmout$`.
====

The output tells you the following:

* The rule with full ID `xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_accounts_tmout` has been tested in the `OSPP` profile context.
* There were 4 test scenarios `comment.fail.sh`, `line_not_there.fail.sh`, `correct_value.pass.sh` and `wrong_value.fail.sh`, all of them passed.
These scenarios test whether the rule can handle various situations correctly.
We will examine these test scenarios later in this lab exercise.
For now, it is important to realize that all the scenarios should still pass after we do any changes in the OVAL.
* More information about the test run is available in the respective log directory.
This is useful when a test breaks unexpectedly, or the test suite suffers from internal issues.

Now when we have a reasonable certainty about our rules, we can improve the OVAL content.

TIP: We will repeat the (re)build of the content and subsequent test suite execution multiple times.
Therefore, it may be practical to dedicate a terminal window for this purpose.
You can browse the command history using `Up` and `Down` keyboard arrows keys, so if you want to rebuild after the tests run finishes, tap the `Up` key until the `build_product` command shows up (typically you have to tap twice), and confirm the execution of the build command by pressing `Enter`.


== Lab 5.6 OVAL optimization

In this section, we will analyze the OVAL check for the `accounts_tmout` rule, and we will perform the following steps:

. Analyze the OVAL, identify duplicated elements.
. Design a jinja2 macro that deduplicates test definitions.
. Test changes.
. Design a jinja2 macro that deduplicates test objects.
. Test changes again.

// This comment is here just to break the numbered list.


=== Lab 5.6.1 Code duplication analysis

The OVAL test repeats itself a little bit - there are checks for the `/etc/profile` file, as well as for other `/etc/profile.d/*.sh` files, but the tests and respective objects are very similar.
This makes editing tedious and prone to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_and_paste_programming#/media/File:Forgotten_edits_in_copypaste_programming.gif[copy-paste errors].
Luckily, `ComplianceAsCode` supports the http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/[jinja2] macro language that can be used to introduce templating, thus removing this duplicity.

Let's analyze what is the difference between the two tests:

There is a difference in name and comment, and test objects are also different.
Compare the two following excerpts:

[source,xml]
----
<ind:textfilecontent54_test check="all" check_existence="all_exist"
    comment="TMOUT in /etc/profile" id="test_etc_profile_tmout" version="1">
  <ind:object object_ref="object_etc_profile_tmout" />
  <ind:state state_ref="state_etc_profile_tmout" />
</ind:textfilecontent54_test>
...

<ind:textfilecontent54_test check="all" check_existence="all_exist"
    comment="TMOUT in /etc/profile.d/*.sh" id="test_etc_profiled_tmout" version="1">
  <ind:object object_ref="object_etc_profiled_tmout" />
  <ind:state state_ref="state_etc_profile_tmout" />
</ind:textfilecontent54_test>
...
----

We have `etc_profile_tmout` and `etc_profiled_tmout` (i.e. there is the extra **d**) in test ID and in the object reference.


=== Lab 5.6.2 Deduplication of tests

Luckily, the Jinja2 language enables us to define http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#macros[macros] that can help us to remove the duplication.
We are going to define a macro that accepts the filename comment and the test stem as arguments.

Therefore, we remove both tests, and we add the new macro and its new invocations.

TIP: We will now be editing files in the rule directory, and building the content and testing.
Therefore, it is advantageous to reserve one terminal window for builds and tests, and the other one for edits.

TIP: To delete a text section in `nano`, move the cursor to the start of the text you want to select.
Then, press the `Alt-A` key combination to mark the start, then move the cursor to the end of the section you want to select.
Finally, press `Ctrl+K` to erase the selection.
Undo by pressing `Alt+U`, redo by `Alt-E`.

----
[... lab5_oval]$ cd linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout
[... accounts_tmout]$ nano oval/shared.xml
----

Now, delete the two `textfilecontent54_test` XML elements, and paste the following content there instead, i.e. between the `definition` and the first of the `textfilecontent54_object` elements:

[source,xml]
----

  {{% macro test_tmout(test_stem, files) %}}
  <ind:textfilecontent54_test check="all" check_existence="all_exist"
      comment="TMOUT in {{{ files }}}" id="test_{{{ test_stem }}}" version="1">
    <ind:object object_ref="object_{{{ test_stem }}}" />
    <ind:state state_ref="state_etc_profile_tmout" />
  </ind:textfilecontent54_test>
  {{% endmacro %}}

  {{{ test_tmout(  test_stem="etc_profile_tmout", files="/etc/profile") }}}
  {{{ test_tmout(  test_stem="etc_profiled_tmout", files="/etc/profile.d/*.sh") }}}
----

Finish your edits as usually by pressing `Ctrl+X` followed by `y` and `Enter`.

NOTE: Note that the delimiters are different than the https://jinja.pocoo.org/docs[Jinja2] website shows - i.e. instead of `{% macro ... %}` on the website, we use the `{{% macro ... %}}` form and so on - there is always one curly brace more than the website documentation shows.


=== Lab 5.6.3 Checking that we are safe

Anyway, did we do everything right?
Let's rebuild the datastream, and let's execute the test suite again - the result should be exactly the same.

TIP: You can use the `Up` keyboard key to browse the command history, so you don't have to retype them all over again every time.

....
[... rule_accounts_tmout]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval
[... lab5_oval]$ ./build_product rhel7
...
[... lab5_oval]$ sudo tests/test_suite.py rule --container ssg_test_suite --datastream build/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml accounts_tmout
...
INFO - Logging into /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval/logs/...

INFO - Script correct_value.pass.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
INFO - Script wrong_value.fail.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
....


=== Lab 5.6.4 Deduplication of objects

Next, the test objects are very similar too - the only thing that differs is their name, and path + filename / filepath attributes.
So we are going to define a macro that accepts the test name stem, and `path`, `filename`, or `filepath` attributes.

We are going to use the http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#if[if-statement] here - if e.g. `filepath` is not supplied, `{{% if filepath %}}` will evaluate to `False`, and the body of the condition will be ignored.
Conversely, if the `filepath` is supplied, the `textfilecontent54_object` definition created by the macro will include the `ind:filepath` child element holding the respective value.

----
[... lab5_oval]$ cd linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout
[... accounts_tmout]$ nano oval/shared.xml
----

Remove the two `textfilecontent54_object` XML elements, and paste the following block as a replacement, i.e. between the test creation and the `textfilecontent54_state` XML element:

[source,xml]
----
  {{% macro object_tmout(test_stem, path, filename, filepath) %}}
  <ind:textfilecontent54_object id="object_{{{ test_stem }}}" version="1">
    {{% if path %}}
    <ind:path>{{{ path }}}</ind:path>
    {{% endif %}}
    {{% if filename %}}
    <ind:filename operation="pattern match">{{{ filename }}}</ind:filename>
    {{% endif %}}
    {{% if filepath %}}
    <ind:filepath>{{{ filepath }}}</ind:filepath>
    {{% endif %}}
    <ind:pattern operation="pattern match">^[\s]*TMOUT[\s]*=[\s]*(.*)[\s]*$</ind:pattern>
    <ind:instance datatype="int">1</ind:instance>
  </ind:textfilecontent54_object>
  {{% endmacro %}}

  {{{ object_tmout(test_stem="etc_profile_tmout", filepath="/etc/profile") }}}
  {{{ object_tmout(test_stem="etc_profiled_tmout", path="/etc/profile.d", filename="^.*\.sh$") }}}
----

Finish your edits as usually by pressing `Ctrl+X` followed by `y` and `Enter`.

To actually create tests and objects, macros have to be called.
Therefore, let's do it and place the macro calls close to each other - it will emphasize that there are two tests - `etc_profile_tmout` that examines the single file, and `etc_profiled_tmout` that goes through the whole directory.

If you get errors during the build or during the tests and you don't know how to fix it, we get you covered:
The snippet below represents the OVAL file after performing the deduplication described in the previous section.
To get back to the track, paste the text below to the `linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout/oval/shared.xml` file.

=== Lab 5.6.5 Reassuring that we are safe

Finally, let's run the rule's test again - it may be that a typo got in, so the OVAL isn't really correct:

....
[... rule_accounts_tmout]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval
[... lab5_oval]$ ./build_product rhel7
...
[... lab5_oval]$ sudo tests/test_suite.py rule --container ssg_test_suite --datastream build/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml accounts_tmout
...
INFO - Logging into /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval/logs/...

....

As there are no errors, this proves that our check-remediation combination works as expected.


== Lab 5.7 OVAL development


=== Lab 5.7.1 Correct handling of supercompliance

Let's examine the test scenarios - for example the `wrong_value.fail.sh`.
Open a new terminal window, and change to the test definitions directory.
The directory structure under the `tests/data` directory is analogous to the directory structure under `linux_os/guide`:

----
[... lab5_oval]$ cd tests/data/group_system/group_accounts/group_accounts-session/rule_accounts_tmout
----

Then, let's open the `wrong_value.fail.sh` file.


----
[... rule_accounts_tmout]$ nano wrong_value.fail.sh
----

As you can see, the test sets the `TMOUT` value to 1234.
The value is correctly considered as noncompliant - as the timeout should be 600, 1234 is longer, therefore less secure.
After you are finished with looking, press `Ctrl+X` to bring up the "save and exit" option.
If you are asked about saving any changes, you probably don't want that, in which case press `n`.

What about the `correct.pass.sh`?
Let's check that out and open it in the editor as well:

----
[... rule_accounts_tmout]$ nano correct.pass.sh
----

As we can see, this one sets the `TMOUT` value to 600, which is the value defined by the profile.
After you are finished with looking, press `Ctrl+X` to bring up the "save and exit" option.
If you are asked about saving any changes, you probably don't want that, in which case press `n`.

Let's add another check for a correct value - let's check for timeout of 100.
In case of a timeout, 100 seconds is more secure than 600 seconds.
Therefore, the scenario is represents a *supercompliant* case, i.e. the setting is stricter than necessary, but it is within the area of allowed values.
So let's copy that one, and make a new test scenario out of it.
Run this command in the terminal in the `rule_accounts_tmout` directory:

----
[... rule_accounts_tmout]$ cp correct_value.pass.sh supercompliant.pass.sh
----

Then, open it in the `nano` editor, and change the value 600 to 100.

----
[... rule_accounts_tmout]$ nano supercompliant.pass.sh
----

After you are finished with the edit, press `Ctrl+x` to bring up the "save and exit" option, and confirm that you want to save the changes and exit by pressing `y` followed by `Enter`.
For reference, the `supercompliant.pass.sh` file now looks like this:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
#
# profiles = xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp

if grep -q "TMOUT" /etc/profile; then
        sed -i "s/.*TMOUT.*/TMOUT=100/" /etc/profile
else
        echo "TMOUT=100" >> /etc/profile
fi
----

Now, let's get back to the tests and run them:

....

[... rule_accounts_tmout]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval
[... lab5_oval]$ ./build_product rhel7
...
[... lab5_oval]$ sudo tests/test_suite.py rule --container ssg_test_suite --datastream build/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml accounts_tmout
...
INFO - Logging into /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval/logs/...
INFO - xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_accounts_tmout
INFO - Script correct_value.pass.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
INFO - Script comment.fail.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
ERROR - Script supercompliant.pass.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp found issue:

ERROR - The initial scan failed for rule 'xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_accounts_tmout'.
INFO - Script line_not_there.fail.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
INFO - Script wrong_value.fail.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
....

The test output tells us that the `supercompliant.pass.sh` scenario has failed, which was not expected.
Let's modify the OVAL snippet, so timeouts shorter than the threshold are allowed:

....
[... lab5_oval]$ cd linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout
[... accounts_tmout]$ nano oval/shared.xml
....

The modification should be easy - instead of checking that the timeout value `equals` the threshold, we will use the `less than or equal` check as per the https://oval.mitre.org/language/version5.11/ovaldefinition/documentation/oval-common-schema.html#OperationEnumeration[OVAL specification]:
So just replace `equals` with `less than or equal` in the definition of the `textfilecontent54_state` like this:

[source,xml]
----
  <ind:textfilecontent54_state id="state_etc_profile_tmout" version="1">
    <ind:subexpression datatype="int" operation="less than or equal" var_check="all" var_ref="var_accounts_tmout" />
  </ind:textfilecontent54_state>
----

After you are finished with edits, press `Ctrl+x` to bring up the "save and exit" option, and confirm that you want to save the changes and exit by pressing `y` followed by `Enter`.
This time, when rebuilt and executed again, tests pass:

....
[... accounts_tmout]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval
[... lab5_oval]$ ./build_product rhel7
...
[... lab5_oval]$ sudo python3 tests/test_suite.py rule --container ssg_test_suite --datastream build/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml accounts_tmout

....


=== Lab 5.7.2 Correct handling of export

As discussed at the beginning of this exercise, the `TMOUT` variable may be prefixed by the `export` keyword - this is allowed, but not required.
So let's modify the passing test scenario `correct_value.pass.sh` to test a correct value in addition to the usage of the `export` keyword:

----
[... lab5_oval]$ nano tests/data/group_system/group_accounts/group_accounts-session/rule_accounts_tmout/correct_value.pass.sh 
----

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
#
# profiles = xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp

if grep -q "TMOUT" /etc/profile; then
        sed -i "s/.*TMOUT.*/export TMOUT=600/" /etc/profile
else
        echo "export TMOUT=600" >> /etc/profile
fi
----

After you are finished with edits, press `Ctrl+x` to bring up the "save and exit" option, and confirm that you want to save the changes and exit by pressing `y` followed by `Enter`.

Time to re-run those tests!
We don't have to rebuild the product, as we have changed only the test definition, and we can re-run the test suite without the prior rebuild.
Now, we execute the test suite again, and we expect the `Script correct_value.pass.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp found issue:` line to appear in the output.

----
[... lab5_oval]$ sudo python3 tests/test_suite.py rule --container ssg_test_suite --datastream build/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml accounts_tmout
...
----

This confirms the theory that OVAL doesn't allow this configuration, although it is valid.
Therefore, in order to make tests pass, we will have to edit the OVAL, so the occurrence of `export` is allowed.
Thanks to the OVAL optimization that we have performed before, there is only one place that needs to be changed - it is the definition of the test object.

So let's open the OVAL file again:

....
[... lab5_oval]$ cd linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout
[... accounts_tmout]$ nano oval/shared.xml
....

The current test object specifies

[source,xml]
----
<ind:pattern operation="pattern match">^[\s]*TMOUT[\s]*=[\s]*(.*)[\s]*$</ind:pattern>
<ind:instance datatype="int">1</ind:instance>
----

and it needs to be changed to ignore the `export` keyword followed by at least one whitespace.

The best approach is to make this an optional group.
This would mean adding `(export[\s]+)?` to the regular expression, but as we don't want that group to be registered (i.e. stored in memory, captured), we have to https://oval.mitre.org/language/about/re_support_5.6.html[add some special syntax], so we add `(?:export[\s]+)`, and the section becomes

[source,xml]
----
<ind:pattern operation="pattern match">^[\s]*(?:export[\s]+)?TMOUT[\s]*=[\s]*(.*)[\s]*$</ind:pattern>
<ind:instance datatype="int">1</ind:instance>
----

The non-capturing group that consists of `export` followed by at least one whitespace can be either absent or present exactly once.

Time to save the OVAL, using the `Ctrl+X`, `y` and `Enter`, rebuild the product and run the tests again:

....
[... accounts_tmout]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval
[... lab5_oval]$ ./build_product rhel7
...
[... lab5_oval]$ sudo python3 tests/test_suite.py rule --container ssg_test_suite --datastream build/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml accounts_tmout
INFO - The base image option has been specified, choosing Podman-based test environment.
INFO - Logging into /home/lab-user/labs/lab5_oval/logs/...
INFO - xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_accounts_tmout
INFO - Script comment.fail.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
INFO - Script line_not_there.fail.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
INFO - Script correct_value.pass.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
INFO - Script wrong_value.fail.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
INFO - Script supercompliant.pass.sh using profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp OK
....

Everything passes, which means that our check can now handle a range of compliant values, as well as doesn't produce false positives when the `export` keyword is involved.

Congratulations - now you know how use the `ComplianceAsCode` project to make OVAL creation less error-prone, and how to make sure that OVAL checks are working according to expectations.
