= Lab 1: Say Hello to ComplianceAsCode

:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

== Introduction

In this lab, we will get familiar with the `ComplianceAsCode` project. The purpose of this project is to help users create security policy content for various platforms. The `ComplianceAsCode` project enables users to efficiently develop and share security content.

Using the powerful build system, you can generate output in various formats such as Ansible Playbooks or SCAP datastreams
that you can use to automate security auditing and hardening.
The project contains many useful rules and checks that form various security policies and enables users to easily add new rules and checks.

We will work with the project source repository: https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the SCAP content generated from ComplianceAsCode data is shipped as the `scap-security-guide` RPM package.

== Goal of Lab 1:

* Learn about the `ComplianceAsCode` project to understand what is where and what can you use the project for.
* Learn how to build the content from the source and go through what gets built.
* Understand how to find the source of a particular part of the built artifact.
* Learn how to parametrize rules that use variables.
* Learn where to find additional rule content, such as checks and remediations.


== Pre-Configured and Already Set Up for you:

* The `ComplianceAsCode` repository has already been cloned to all of the */home/lab-user/labs/** directories. So for example, */home/lab-user/labs/lab1-introduction* is a clone of the ComplianceAsCode project repository.
* The following dependencies that are required for the `ComplianceAsCode` content build have already been installed using `yum install`:
** generic build utilities: `cmake`, `make`,
** utilities for generating SCAP content: `openscap-utils`,
** and Python dependencies for putting content together: `python3-pyyaml`, `python3-jinja2`.


=== Steps to do

On the remote desktop, we are going to browse the project files and open some of them e.g. in a web browser.
Click on `Activites` at the top left of your desktop and click on the file cabinet icon to open the file explorer.

image::desktopfilefolder.png[100,100]

Just to make sure, click the `Home` icon in the left upper part of the file explorer window.
Then, navigate to the location of the exercise by double-clicking on the `labs` folder, followed by double-clicking the
`lab1_introduction`
folder. The whole exercise will take place under the
`/home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction`
folder that we will access from both text and graphical consoles.

Now log in to the VM using the text console if you haven't done so already.
Open the terminal window on the lab laptop.
Execute the following command,
but don't forget to replace `GUID` with your lab provided GUID:

----
~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$
----


=== Lab 1.1 Building the content

The ComplianceAsCode project consists of human readable files that are compiled into standard-compliant files that are difficult to read and edit directly.

Now let's go ahead and start building the content!

The https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content[ComplianceAsCode/content] project uses https://cmake.org/[CMake] build system.
The build itself is based on: Python, the `oscap` tool, and XSLT transformations.

To build the content, take the following steps:

. First, go to the text console, i.e. the Terminal window of your laptop.
Navigate to */home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction*.
+
----
~]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction
----

. From this directory, run `./build_product rhel8` to compile content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
+
----
lab1_introduction]$ ./build_product rhel8
----
+
It is possible to also build content for other products.
A product may be either an operating system, eg. RHEL 8, RHEL 7, Fedora, or they can be applications, e.g. Firefox, Java, and so on.
+
In general, you can run `./build_product <product>` to build only the content for a product you are interested in.
The `<product>` is the lowercase form of the product, so you would run: `./build_product rhel8` to build content for RHEL 8, `./build_product fedora` to build content for Fedora, and so on.

.Build of security content for RHEL 8 has finished in the terminal window.

We will now explore the built content in the subsequent lab exercises.

=== Lab 1.2 Viewing the provided HTML guides for the ComplianceAsCode project

The `ComplianceAsCode` project provides HTML guides that are a great resource for those interested in what rules a policy consists of.
The HTML guides are located in the respective `build/guides` of each lab exercise subdirectory. Therefore, the full path of the directory for this lab exercise is:

----
/home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction/build/guides/
----

In the `ComplianceAsCode` project, policies are referred to as security profiles.
The HTML guide filenames have a `ssg-<product>-guide-<profile>.html` form, so the HTML guide for the RHEL 8 Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems (OSPP profile) has the `ssg-rhel8-guide-ospp.html` form.

. Now, let's take a look at one of the provided HTML guides in a web browser. Go back to the console of your lab VM by going to the tab that you have opened of the lab environment's *power control and consoles page* from Lab 0.
If you need to log in again as the *Lab User*, the password is *r3dh4t1!*.
+
image::vmconsole.png[200,200]

. Remember how we opened the file explorer at the beginning of this exercise?
Click the `Activities` buttion at the top left corner, and click the folder icon again.
The file explorer window will come up again.
+
We will now use it to open the HTML guide in a web browser.
Let's navigate to the location of the HTML guides.
Being in the `lab1_introduction` directory, you just have to click the *build* folder, followed by the *guides* folder.
Then, double click on the *ssg-rhel8-guide-ospp.html* file to open the HTML guide for the RHEL 8 OSPP profile.
+
image::navigateospp.png[1000,1000]

. Rules are organized in a system of hierarchical groups. Take a look through this HTML guide to see the various rules of the RHEL 8 OSPP profile.

=== Lab 1.3 Updating a Rule Description to Find the Source of a Specific Rule

We will now take a closer look at a specific rule in the HTML guide of the RHEL 8 OSPP profile.
For example, let's take a closer look at the *Set Interactive Session Timeout*  rule entry.

. In the HTML guide of the RHEL 8 OSPP profile that you have opened in Firefox, press `Ctrl+F` and search for `session timeout`.

.The *Set Interactive Session Timeout* rule in the RHEL 8 OSPP profile HTML guide
image::session_timeout.png[]
{empty} +

. Check out the description just below the *Set Interactive Session Timeout* rule:
+
----
Setting the TMOUT option in /etc/profile ensures that Setting the TMOUT option in /etc/profile ensures that all user sessions will terminate based on inactivity. The TMOUT setting in /etc/profile should read as follows:

TMOUT=1800
----

. Notice that the following text is written twice in this rule, on purpose, for lab demonstration purposes: *Setting the TMOUT option in /etc/profile ensures that*. Let's go ahead and fix this so we can understand how rule definitions are created and updated.

. Let's locate this twice written rule definition text. Rule definitions for Linux systems are under the *linux_os/guide* directory of the `ComplianceAsCode` project. Remember that the `ComplianceAsCode` project has already been cloned to all of the /home/lab-user/labs/* directories. So for example, /home/lab-user/labs/lab1-introduction is a clone of the ComplianceAsCode project repository. Since there is about a thousand rules, it is better to search all rules for the text, rather than trying a to find a particular rule in the directory hierarchy by browsing it.

. Rules definitions are written as YAML files, that are particularly great at storing key-value data.
All rules are defined by the respective `rule.yml` file, and the parent folder is the respective rule’s ID.
ID of the rule in question is `accounts_tmout`. Given that, we can search for the directory.

. Go to the Terminal window of your laptop. SSH into the workstation bastion host as *lab-user*. Don't forget to replace *GUID* with your lab provided *GUID*!
+
[source, text]
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$

. Make sure that you are in the */home/lab-user/labs/lab1-introduction* directory and execute the following *find* command. This command searches for a file or directory named exactly `accounts_tmout` in the directory subtree below the linux_os directory.
+
[source, text]
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab1-introduction
[lab-user@workstation-GUID lab1_introduction]$ find linux_os -name accounts_tmout
. You will get the following output after typing in the above find command:
+
[source,text]
[lab-user@workstation-GUID lab1_introduction]$ find linux_os -name accounts_tmout
[lab-user@workstation-GUID lab1_introduction]$ linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout

+
Notice that the `linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout` directory reported as the result, and the rule is defined in the `rule.yml` file that is in that directory.

. Now, open up the `rule.yml` file so we can remove this repeated text that we saw earlier: *Setting the TMOUT option in /etc/profile ensures that*:
+
[source, text]
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction
[lab-user@workstation-GUID lab1-introduction]$ nano linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout/rule.yml

. Luckily, the rule’s description is right at the upper part of the `rule.yml`.
Remove the repeated text occurrence of *Setting the <tt>TMOUT</tt> option in <tt>/etc/profile</tt> ensures that*.
Press `Ctrl+x` to bring up the "save and exit" option, and confirm that you want to save the changes and exit by pressing `y` followed by `Enter`.

. Now let's recompile the content to check whether our fix worked.
. Go to the following directory: */home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction*. Then, recompile the content from this directory.
+
[source,text]
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction
[lab-user@workstation-GUID lab1_introduction]$ ./build_product rhel8

+
. Go back to the HTML guide of the RHEL 8 OSPP profile *that's open in Firefox of your lab environment's console*. Refresh your web browser.

. Review the fix.
You should see the fixed description now without the repeated *Setting the TMOUT option in /etc/profile ensures that* text if you scroll down to the *Set Interactive Session Timeout* rule.


=== Lab 1.4 Customizing a Parametrized Rule
In this lab exercise, we will learn about parametrized rules. Parametrization can be used to set timeout durations, password length, umask, and other settings.

In this lab exercise, we will learn about parametrized rules by: seeing where the value comes from, learning how is it applied to the rule, changing the parametrized rule and observing the result, and finally learning what happens when the variable is omitted.

// TO BE DONE :-)
. Modifying parametrized rules is very easy, as this rule doesn’t have the timeout duration hardcoded - it is parametrized by a variable.
As the description for the *Set Interactive Session Timeout* rule says, the rule uses the `timeout` variable. This is defined in the `var_accounts_tmout.var` file.
Similarly as in the previous step, we can search for the variable definition:
+
----
$ find linux_os -name var_accounts_tmout.var
linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/var_accounts_tmout.var
----
+
That `var_accounts_tmout.var` file contains variable description, which is helpful - one can't be sure what the number 1800 means, however the contents of the file indicate that it is the same as 30 minutes, i.e. 1800 seconds.

. The rule is parametrized per profile.
As there can be multiple profiles in one datastream file, one rule can exist in multiple profiles, and it can be parametrized differently in different profiles.
+
To see how the rule is connected to it’s variable, we have to check out the respective profile definition, i.e. `rhel8/profiles/ospp.profile`.
Open it by e.g. `gedit`, and search for `accounts_tmout` (use the `Ctrl + F` keyboard shortcut or use the `Edit->Find in this page` menu item to bring up the search field):
+
----
    ...
    ### FMT_MOF_EXT.1 / AC-11(a)
    ### Set Screen Lock Timeout Period to 30 Minutes or Less
    - accounts_tmout
    - var_accounts_tmout=30_min
    ...
----
+
Therefore, it is obvious now where the timeout duration comes from and how to change it.

. Modify the entry, and  put `10_min` there.
Then, rebuild the content by executing `./build_product rhel8` in the project root, and wait for the result.
It is important to note that variables aren't continuous - the set of possible values that the variable can have are pre-defined in the file.
After the build finishes, refresh the HTML guide by either reloading it in the browser, or by reopening `build/guides/ssg-rhel8-guide-ospp.html`.
The variable value should be updated to 600.

. What happens if we omit the variable definition?
Open the OSPP profile file in an editor, and comment the line containing `- var_accounts_tmout=30_min` out by inserting `#` just before the leading dash.
Then, rebuild the content again by executing `./build_product rhel8` in the project root.
+
But we have things to do before the build finishes - let’s re-examine the variable definition - maybe we can tell what will be the result!
Open the variable definition in an editor - execute:
+
----
$ gedit linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/var_accounts_tmout.var
----
+
In this YAML file, we have the `options:` key, that defines mappings between the supplied and effective values.
As the `default: 600` line indicates, if we don’t specify the timeout duration in a profile, it is going to be 600 seconds, i.e. 10 minutes.
Time to review the HTML guide - when refreshing or reopening `build/guides/ssg-rhel8-guide-ospp.html`, we can clearly see the rule's timeout indeed equals to 600.

NOTE: The set of values a variable can have is discrete - all values have to be defined in the variable file.
Therefore, it is possible to specify `var_accounts_tmout=20_min` in the profile only after adding `20_min: 1200` to the `options:` key of the variable definition.


== Associated content

A rule needs more than a description to be of any use - you need to be able:

* to check whether the system complies to the rule definition, and
* to restore an incompliant system to a compliant state.

For these reasons, a rule should contain a check, and possibly also remediations.
The additional content is placed in subdirectories of the rule, so let's explore our `accounts_tmout` rule.

We can browse the associated content if we list the contents of the directory.
Run in the terminal:

----
$ cd linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout
$ ls
ansible  bash  oval  rule.yml
----


We will describe currently-supported associated content types:


=== Checks

Checks can be found under the `oval` directory.
They are written in an standardized, declarative, XML-based language called OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language).
Writing checks in this language is considered cumbersome, but the ComplianceAsCode project helps users to write it more efficiently.

We won't go into details of OVAL now, we just point out that the OVAL content can be found in a rule's subdirectory `oval`.
The OVAL checks will be described in the Exercise 5.
// The browser cannot handle the xml file because there are namespaces that are not bound, so we advise to open it with a text editor
If you are familiar with the language, you may take the opportunity to examine the `oval` subdirectory of the `accounts_tmout` rule's directory - there is the `shared.xml` file.
The `shared.xml` file features a shorthand OVAL, which is much simpler than the full-bodied OVAL that you would have to write otherwise.


=== Remediations

If the system is not set up according to the rule description, the scanner reports that the rule has failed, and the system administrator is supposed to fix it.
The `ComplianceAsCode` content provides users with snippets that they can run and that can make the system compliant again, or that can provide administrators with hint of what they need to do.

Remediations are expected to work on the clean installation configuration - if the administrator made some changes in the meantime, remediations are not guaranteed to work.

The majority of rules present in profiles comes with a Bash remediation, and still a large number of them has Ansible remediations.
Anaconda remediations are used to guide the user during system installation.
We also support remediations in a form of a Puppet script.

Remediations can be found under `bash`, `ansible`, `anaconda` or `puppet` directories.

For example, in rule `accounts_tmout` there is a remediation in form of a Bash script located in the `bash` subdirectory of the rule directory.
Run `ls bash` to display contents of the `bash` directory - there is a `shared.sh` file there.
The `shared` basename has a special meaning - it indicates that the remediation can be used with any product.
If the remediation had been named `rhel8.sh`, it would have meant that is a RHEL8-only remediation, i.e. one not to be used to remediate RHEL7 systems.
This name-coding is relevant for all types of additional content.


Unlike checks, you can review remediations in the guide - there is a `(show)` clickable to do so.
Therefore, bring back the browser window with the guide opened, and see for yourself.

.Bash remediation snippet shown in the HTML guide
image::0-03-remediation.png[]
{empty} +
We can try edit the remediation script.
We will add a comment there that describes that the numerical value is number of seconds.
We will check out the `linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout/bash/shared.sh` file.
We can see that there are some extra lines, but it corresponds to the content displayed in the guide.
The line saying `populate var_accounts_tmout` is the line that gets transformed into the variable assignment statement.
We will put the explanatory comment just above it:

----
# platform = Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7,Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8,multi_platform_fedora,multi_platform_ol
. /usr/share/scap-security-guide/remediation_functions
# The timeout delay is defined by number of seconds
populate var_accounts_tmout

if grep --silent ^TMOUT /etc/profile ; then
        sed -i "s/^TMOUT.*/TMOUT=$var_accounts_tmout/g" /etc/profile
else
        echo -e "\n# Set TMOUT to $var_accounts_tmout per security requirements" >> /etc/profile
        echo "TMOUT=$var_accounts_tmout" >> /etc/profile
fi
----

Don't forget to save the change after you are done with it.

Now is the time to rebuild the guide using `./build_product rhel8` command and refresh the guide - the remediation should contain the newly added comment.
