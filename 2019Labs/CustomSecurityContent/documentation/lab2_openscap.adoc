= Lab Exercise 2: Automated Security Scanning Using ComplianceAsCode

:imagesdir: images

== Introduction

As we already know from link:lab1_introduction.adoc[Exercise 1], the ComplianceAsCode project provides security content that can be used for automated security scanning of the system.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 contains OpenSCAP Scanner, which is a security scanner that works perfectly with ComplianceAsCode content.
The content that we build in ComplianceAsCode can be simply passed to OpenSCAP Scanner and the scan can be started right away.

OpenSCAP Scanner allows you to perform security compliance checks in a fully automated way.
It is possible to run the scan using either a command line  tool `oscap` or a graphical application SCAP Workbench.
Several integrations for continuous scanning also exist but in this lab Exercise, we will focus on one-off scanning.

== What you will learn

* ... basics of automated security scanning in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
* ... using ComplianceAsCode for automated security scanning.
* ... how to do lightweight customization of a predefined security policy using a GUI tool.
* ... what are the possibilities for remediations of failing rules.


== What we have done for you

* We have cloned the ComplianceAsCode repository to the `lab2_openscap` directory.
* We have installed dependencies that are required for the ComplianceAsCode content build using `yum install`:
** generic build utilities: `cmake`, `make`,
** utilities for generating SCAP content: `openscap-utils`,
** and Python dependencies for putting content together: `python3-pyyaml`, `python3-jinja2`.
* We have installed the OpenSCAP ecosystem packages, using `yum install`:
** The scanner: `openscap-scanner`,
** utilities for scanning remote systems `openscap-utils`,
** GUI frontend and datastream tool `scap-workbench`


== Introducing OpenSCAP command line tool

OpenSCAP provides a command line tool `oscap` that can be used for automated security scanning.

You can verify a successful installation of `oscap` tool by running:

----
[... lab1_introduction]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab2_openscap
[... lab2_openscap]$ oscap --version

OpenSCAP command line tool (oscap) 1.3.0
Copyright 2009--2018 Red Hat Inc., Durham, North Carolina.

==== Supported specifications ====
XCCDF Version: 1.2
OVAL Version: 5.11.1

...
----

Notice that this command outputs the OpenSCAP version and versions of supported standards.

== Using ComplianceAsCode content with OpenSCAP command line tool

In this Section we will build the security content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 from ComplianceAsCode source code and then we will use the built content with OpenSCAP command line tool to scan our machine.

. The content has been built, so we can take a look at the generated files in the `build` directory right away:
+
----
[... lab2_openscap]$ cd build
[... build]$ ls
...
ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
ssg-rhel8-ocil.xml
ssg-rhel8-oval.xml
...
----
+
There are multiple files produced by the build. The file that is going to be used with the OpenSCAP scanner is `ssg-rhel8-ds.xml`. This file is called a SCAP Datastream.
+
. Check which compliance profiles are available for RHEL8.
+
----
[... build]$ oscap info ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
...
    Profiles:
        Title: Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Security Policy
            Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cjis
        Title: Unclassified Information in Non-federal Information Systems and Organizations (NIST 800-171)
            Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cui
        Title: Red Hat Corporate Profile for Certified Cloud Providers (RH CCP)
            Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_rht-ccp
...
----
+
In the "Profiles:" section you can see a list of profiles contained in the datastream.
The datastream contains multiple profiles that cover different security baselines for different purposes.
Each profile is identified by a profile ID.
+
The built ComplianceAsCode content is available as a RHEL `scap-security-guide` RPM package.
Unlike the upstream repository that we work with now, the package contains only content that is officially tested and supported by Red Hat.
Therefore, the `scap-security-guide` package in RHEL 8 contains only the OSPP and PCI-DSS profiles at the moment.
+
. Perform our first baseline testing scan with the vanilla OSPP profile.
+
Notice in our command below that we can skip the profile ID prefix to make the command simpler.
The real ID is `xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp`.
+
The scanning command has to be executed by a privileged user using `sudo`, so the scanner can access system parts that are off-limits to common users.
The simplest scanner invocation can look like this:
+
----
sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile ospp ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
----
+
However, we will also want to store the scan results, so we can process them later.
Therefore, we have to supply additional arguments:
+
--
* use `--results-arf` to get machine readable results archive
* use `--report` to get human readable report (can also be generated from ARF after the scan as you see in the next optional step)
* use `--oval-results` to get detailed results in the report

So now, execute:

----
[... build]$ sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile ospp --results-arf /tmp/arf.xml --report /home/lab-user/labs/lab2_openscap/report.html --oval-results ./ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
...
----

to run the scan, generating the HTML report as a side-effect.

[NOTE]
====
You can also generate the HTML report later by executing

----
[... build]$ sudo rm -f /home/lab-user/labs/lab2_openscap/report.html
[... build]$ oscap xccdf generate report /tmp/arf.xml > /home/lab-user/labs/lab2_openscap/report.html
----

. Open the file explorer application by clicking `Activities`, and then the blue cabinet icon.
Once it comes up, click the `Home` entry at the upper left part of the browser's window.
Then, click `labs` and `lab2_openscap` directories.
The `lab2_report.html` file should be one of the files there, so double-click it to open it in the browser.
+
image:getting-report.png[]
+
You will see the compliance scan results for every security control in the OSPP security baseline profile in HTML format.
+
image:lab1.1-scapreport.png[]

. Rules can have several types of results but the most common ones are *pass* and *fail*, which indicate whether a particular security control has passed or failed the scan.
Other results you can frequently encounter are *notapplicable*, for rules that have been skipped as not relevant to the scanned system and *notchecked*, for rules without an automated check.

. Click on the rule title in the HTML report.
+
image:lab1.1-clickrule.png[]

. This will bring up a pop-up dialog that allows you to examine why a particular rule failed or passed.
For example, if a rule is testing file permissions on a list of files, it will specify which files failed and what are their permission bits.

== Customizing existing SCAP security content using SCAP Workbench

. In the console view, click *Activities* at the top left part of the screen, and select the green circular icon of SCAP Workbench.

. After Workbench starts, select *Other SCAP content* in a drop-down list, and click on *Load Content*. A file browser window will show up. Locate `ssg-rhel8-ds.xml` from `/home/lab-user/labs/lab2_openscap/build` directory and click to *Open* to open the compliance content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 that we have built in the previous Section.
+
image:load_content.png[]
+
image::scap_workbench_opened.png[SCAP Workbench opened, profile selected]

. Let's customize the PCI-DSS Control baseline.
Select this profile from the *Profile* drop-down list.
Click *Customize*.
+
image:select_profile.png[]

. In the *Customize Profile* pop-up window, leave the default New Profile ID name and click *OK*.
+
image:lab1.2-newprofileID.png[500,500]

. Now you can select and unselect rules according to your organization's needs and change values such as minimum password length to tailor the compliance profile.
After you are done customizing click *OK* to save the profile.
You have now created a new custom profile.
+
image::scap_workbench_tailoring.png[SCAP Workbench content customization]

. Now let's run a test scan with the new custom profile we just created.
Click *Scan* and inspect the results.
When prompted for the password for Lab User, type *r3dh4t1!*.
This will take a few minutes so feel free to move on with the lab exercise and not wait until the scan is completed.
Close the *Diagnostics* window.

== Security Remediations with OpenSCAP, Ansible and Bash
Putting the machine into compliance (for example by changing its configuration) is called *remediation* in the SCAP terminology.
Remediation changes the configuration of the machine and it is possible that you will lock yourself out or disable important workloads!
As a result, it is best practice to test the remediation changes before deploying.

We will use terminal on your laptop again - there's no need to use console view for this part.

. Generate an Ansible Playbook that will put your machine into compliance.
We will generate a playbook from the scan results:
+
Use the `--fix-type ansible` option to request an ansible playbook with the fixes:
+
----
[... build]$ oscap xccdf generate fix --fix-type ansible --result-id "" /tmp/arf.xml > playbook.yml
----
+
We have specified the empty `result-id` because `oscap` supports generation of fixes from  a result file that has results from multiple scans. However, as there is only one result from a single scan, we don't have to specify the result ID explicitly.
+
Check the output using a text editor:
+
----
[... build]$ nano playbook.yml
----
+
. You can exit `nano` by pressing *ctrl + x*
. Generate Bash remediation script from the scan results. This can be accomplished by running:
+
Use `--fix-type bash` to request a bash script with the fixes
+
----
[... build]$ oscap xccdf generate fix --fix-type bash --result-id "" /tmp/arf.xml > bash-fix.sh
----
+
We have specified the empty `result-id` because `oscap` supports generation of fixes from  a result file that has results from multiple scans. However, as there is only one result from a single scan, we don't have to specify the result ID explicitely.
+
Check the output using a text editor:
+
----
[... build]$ nano bash-fix.sh
----

. You can exit `nano` by pressing *ctrl + x*


The Ansible Playbook can be used to configure a system to meet a compliant state. We will discuss using Ansible Playbooks in link:lab4_ansible.adoc[Lab Exercise 4].
The Bash remediation script also can be used to change the configuration of the system.
We recommend to review the contents of these scripts and test them in a testing environment first, as they potentially can do unexpected or harmful changes.
