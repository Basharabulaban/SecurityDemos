* We have cloned the ComplianceAsCode repository to the `content` directory.
* We have installed dependencies that are required for the ComplianceAsCode content build using `dnf install`:
** generic build utilities: `cmake`, `make`,
** utilities for generating SCAP content: `openscap-utils`,
** and Python dependencies for putting content together: `python3-pyyaml`, `python3-jinja2`.
