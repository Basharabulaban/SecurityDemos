You will be given a a 4 character code. This code is called your GUID. Whenever you see GUID in the lab guide, replace it with this code. You will need this for the next step when we verify connectivity to your lab.

=== Logging into your lab environment

. The *Lab GUID Assignment page* contains a list of links to all of the Red Hat Products that you will use in this lab. Click each of the links on this page. Each link should open a new tab. You will have to accept the SSL certificates for each page when the warning appears.
