== Lab 3: How to use the control policy engine in Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Ansible Automation to enforce automated compliance with security policies

== Goal of Lab 3
The goal of this lab is to introduce you to the power and flexibility of Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Ansible Automation to enforce compliance with your security policies in an automated fashion.

Specifically, using a combination of Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Ansible Automation, you will: enforce the installation of the AIDE package, determine if an Openstack instace is vulnerable to the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, and enforce Openstack security group membership.

== Introduction
Red Hat CloudForms provides unified hybrid cloud management across your entire heterogenous environment, including virtual, private cloud, public cloud, and container environments. It is an agentless solution, delivered as a virtual appliance, highly scalable and provides deep continuous visibility and discovery of your entire infrastructure. The Red Hat CloudForms control and policy engine provides compliance and governance capabilities right in the GUI of CloudForms. A control policy is created in the Red Hat CloudForms control and policy engine by defining an Event, Condition, and Action. The Action can be one of the defined actions in the Red Hat CloudForms control engine or it can be free-form automation. The Red Hat CloudForms automate engine can be utilized to execute free-form automation using either the native ruby language or using the integrated Ansible to execute Ansible playbooks.  Red Hat CloudForms is also able to communicate directly to your Ansible Tower instance to execute your Ansible playbooks.

Red Hat Ansible Automation is integrated in Red Hat CloudForms. It is a simple, powerful, and agentless IT automation technology that can help improve your current processes, migrate applications for better optimization, and provide a single language for DevOps practices across your organization including Developers, Operations, and the Security Team.

Ansible Tower by Red Hat provides a graphical user interface for Ansible with a visual dashboard, a centralized API for your Ansible automation, role-based access control for increased security, job scheduling, graphical inventory management, and real-time job status updates thus providing you all the IT automation features you need to support your enterprise.

Red Hat Ansible Automation is great for security automation because it is agentless, only requires SSH/WinRM, supports desired state, is extensible and modular, has a push-based architecture, and provides easy targeting based on facts.
