== Lab 8: Proactive Security and Automated Risk Management with Red Hat Insights

=== Goal of Lab 8
The goal of this lab is to introduce you to the proactive security capabilities of Red Hat Insights. In this lab, we will focus only on the specific security features of Red Hat Insights.

=== Introduction
Red Hat Insights was designed to proactively evaluate the security, performance, and stability of your Red Hat platforms by providing prescriptive analytics of your systems. Red Hat Insights helps move you from reactive to proactive systems management, delivers actionable intelligence, and increases visibility of infrastructure risks and the latest security threats. Operational analytics from Red Hat Insights empowers you to prevent downtime and avoid firefighting while responding faster to new risks.

Red Hat Insights recommendations are tailored for the individual system where risk is detected. This allows you to be certain that actions identified by Insights are validated and have a verified resolution for each detected risk, reducing false positives you may experience from critical risks identified by third-party security scanners. Red Hat Insights provides predictive analysis of security risk in your infrastructure based on a constantly evolving threat feed from Red Hat.

Through analysis of Red Hat Insights metadata and curated knowledge based on over fifteen years of enterprise customer support, Red Hat is able to identify critical security vulnerabilities, statistically frequented risks, and known bad configurations. We scale this knowledge to our customers with Red Hat Insights reporting and alerts, allowing prediction of what will happen on a monitored system, why it will happen, and how to fix a problem before it can occur.

Red Hat Insights functionality is integrated into Red Hat’s Customer Portal, Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat CloudForms, and Ansible Tower by Red Hat.  Recommendations from Red Hat Insights are human-readable and in most cases can simply be copy and pasted into the terminal to resolve the issue. You may also automate remediation of hosts in your infrastructure with Red Hat Insights generated Ansible playbooks or Ansible Tower by Red Hat integration.

=== Lab 8.1 Preparing Red Hat Insights Clients
To prepare Red Hat Insights clients we must first register each node with Satellite and install the Red Hat Insights agent

Notice the *--display-name* parameter. This allows you to set the displayed hostname to something other than the default for a system within Insights. This is useful if you wish to obfuscate the hostnames that are used in analysis. Be aware that hostnames must resolve properly for Ansible playbooks and tower management to work for automated remediation, so the display name should match a valid hostname, even if it isn't the publicly accessible DNS name.

=== Lab 8.2 Manually fixing the payload injection security issue
In this section, we will manually fix the specific *Kernel vulnerable to man-in-the-middle via payload injection (CVE-2016-5696)* on *ic1.summit.example.com* without causing downtime.

. Going back to the Satellite UI, click on *Red Hat Insights → Overview*, where you could see all your registered systems, actions summary (highlighted by priority) as well as latest updates from Red Hat.
+
image:images/lab8.1-insightsoverview.png[1000,1000]

. From your Satellite 6.3 UI, click on *Red Hat Insights → Inventory*.
+
image:images/lab8.1-inventory.png[1000,1000]

. Click on your client VM, which is *ic1.summit.example.com*. You will see the list of issues affecting it when clicking on the system name.
+
image:images/lab8.1-listofissues.png[1000,1000]

. Notice that your system shows up with multiple security vulnerabilities.
+
NOTE: One of the security issues listed is the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerability. This is the security issue that says *Kernel vulnerable to side-channel attacks in modern microprocessors(CVE-2017-573/Spectre, CVE-2017-5754/Meltdown)*. To save time, we will NOT be fixing this particular security issue in this lab exercise since the fix for Meltdown and Spectre requires a kernel upgrade, which requires a reboot of the system.
+
NOTE: Our objective is to fix the payload injection problem without causing downtime, and see that it no longer appears as a vulnerability in Red Hat Insights. Specifically, this payload injection problem causes the kernel to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle via payload injection. A flaw was found in the implementation of the Linux kernel's handling of networking challenge ack link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5961[RFC 5961] where an attacker is able to determine the shared counter. This flaw allows an attacker located on different subnet to inject or take over a TCP connection between a server and client without needing to use a traditional man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

. Use your browser’s search function to search for *payload injection*.
+
image:images/lab8.1-payloadinjectionsearch.png[1000,1000]
+
NOTE: Reading the description for the vulnerability shows that the sysctl variable is set to a level that allows being exploited. We want to do the active mitigation by changing the sysctl variable and making it permanent on reboot. In this case, we do not want to update the kernel or reboot since we don’t want downtime.

. If not already there, log into to the workstation host from your desktop system replacing *GUID* with your lab's *GUID*:
+
[source]
----
[lab-user@localhost ~]$ ssh workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

. If not already root, become *root*, log in to your two Red Hat Insights client machine *ic1.summit.example.com*
+
[source]
----
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ sudo -i
[root@workstation-GUID ~]# ssh ic1.summit.example.com
----

. Now, as *root*, perform the recommended active mitigation. Edit the */etc/sysctl.conf* file to add the mitigation configuration, and reload the kernel configuration:
+
[source]
----
[root@ic1 ~]# echo "net.ipv4.tcp_challenge_ack_limit = 2147483647" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
[root@ic1 ~]# sysctl -p
net.ipv4.tcp_challenge_ack_limit = 100
net.ipv4.tcp_challenge_ack_limit = 2147483647
----

. After applying the active mitigation, we want to have the system report any changes, run the following command as root on ic1.summit.example.com:
+
[source]
----
# redhat-access-insights
Starting to collect Insights data

----

. Wait until this step completes before moving to the next step.
. From your Satellite UI, click on *Red Hat Insights → Inventory*.
+
image:images/lab8.1-insightsinventory.png[1000,1000]

. Click on your client VM, *ic1.summit.example.com*. You will notice than the number of actions has decreased.
+
image:images/lab8.1-actionsdecreased.png[1000,1000]

. Use your browser’s search function to search for *payload injection*. You will notice that this payload injection issue is no longer listed due to fixing the vulnerability.
+
image:images/lab8.1-payloadinjectionsearch-again.png[1000,1000]

. Congratulations, you’re no longer impacted by the payload injection vulnerability!

=== Lab 8.3 Automatically fixing the payload injection security issue via Ansible Playbook

It is also possible to automate some of the issues with an Ansible Playbook that Insights provides us. You can see that in the top left corner of every single issue with the Ansible logo in blue if a playbook is available or in grey if it’s not.

image:images/lab8.2-ansiblelogo.png[1000,1000]

. For this part of the lab exercise, we will fix the payload injection vulnerability using an Ansible playbook versus fixing it manually like we did in the previous exercise. We will execute these steps on the *ic4.summit.exmaple.com* VM.
+
image:images/lab8.2-ansibleavailable.png[1000,1000]

. Now we need to create a plan in which the issues that are found will be solved using an Ansible Playbook. In order to do so, from your Satellite 6.3 UI, click on *Red Hat Insights → Planner*.
+
image:images/lab8.2-ansibleplaybook-payloadinjection.png[1000,1000]

. Click on *Create a plan*.
+
image:images/lab8.2-createaplan.png[1000,1000]

. Naming the plan: Since we're all sharing one big lab environment, the naming of plans is very important, and is primarily how we organize the playbooks we will use for remediation. In this lab name your plan starting with your unique GUID That you were given for this lab. This will make it easier to find when its time to select the plan for remediation.

* For Example, Insights Planner may ask me for a plan name, and my unique GUID is "1a2b3" I might name my plan "1a2b3 Payload Remediation". Type in the name you wish to use for the plan and select *ic4.summit.example.com* for Specific System and choose the *Kernel vulnerable to man-in-the-middle via payload injection (CVE-2016-5696)* CVE and click on *Save*.

+
image:images/lab8.2-playbookbuilder.png[1000,1000]

. As you can see, there are two ways to solve this issue, one is by updating the kernel, and the other one is apply the needed changes to the */etc/sysctl.conf* file, add the mitigation configuration, and reload the kernel configuration.
Insights gives us the opportunity to choose the resolution that we want. In this lab we want to prevent unplanned downtime for this issue, so select *Set sysctl ip4 challenge ack limit* as your preferred choice and then click on the *Save* button.
+
image:images/lab8.2-setacklimit.png[1000,1000]

. Once the plan is saved, the planner screen is shown where you can see the newly created plan, as well as the issues it resolves and the systems affected.
+
image:images/lab8.2-saveplanneroutput.png[1000,1000]

. Now that we have a plan built to resolve the Payload vulnerability for ic4, lets login to Tower and sync the Insights information with Tower. The Tower environment has been mostly pre-configured for your use in this lab.

. We accomplish this by logging into Ansible Tower. Point your browser at https://tower-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com (your GUID was provided to you in an earlier lab, and just like with Satellite replace the GUID with your unique GUID)

. Login with admin / r3dh4t1! as we have done with the other administrative UIs  and clicking the large *Templates* option from the main menu at the top. Find the *Insights Facts Scan* Job and click the *Rocket* under the Actions.
+
image:images/lab8.3-insights-facts-1.png[1000,1000]

. The Job Details output will pop up and you should let the job run to completion. At the end the Status should show Successful.  From here go to the Inventories menu option from the top menu. Click into *Insights Inventory* and then Click *Hosts* and click into *ic4.summit.example.com*.

. By clicking the Insights option for this host you can see all of the risks and vulnerabilities associated with this host. In an upcoming version of Tower you will be able to remediate directly from this interface, but for this lab we will continue using the Insights Planner interface from within Satellite to accomplish our tasks in conjunction with Tower.

. Navigate to *Projects* from the main menu at the top. We will now sync the Plans we created inside of Red Hat Satellite to Tower via the Insights API.

. Under Projects find the premade *Insights Planner Sync* project, and click the Cloud with a download arrow under ACTIONS to the right of the project name.

. The sync should complete successfully, and now you're ready to remediate with Tower. In addition, now Tower can Identify Insights issues on managed hosts. All of the above projects and plans can be sync'd and updated automatically with Tower via the API or with scheduled runs.

+
image:images/lab8.3-insights-template1.png[1000,1000]

. In the Tower UI return to the *Templates* interface from the main menu at the top of the UI. We will create a job template to run one of the plans we created. You should have created the plan with your unique GUID from this lab, so if you did not, you will need to locate your specific plan or create one you can recognize easily from the playbook selection.

. Click *+ADD* in the Templates UI and select the *Job Template* dropdown option. We will create a basic job template for your automated remediation with Insights.

. For the name of the template use: <your GUID> Payload Fix. Job Type should be *Run*. For Inventory select *Insights Inventory*. For Project select *Insights Planner Sync* (you may need to navigate to a different page to find this project). In the Playbook Dropdown Choose a playbook that you created with your unique GUID in the Insights Planner. For credential select *Insights Fix All Machine Credentials*. The final task is to click *Enable Privilege Escalation* under OPTIONS, and click Save.

+
image:images/lab8.3-insights-template2.png[1000,1000]

. Scroll down to where the Templates are listed below the New Template fields, or click Templates from the Main Tower menu. Find the template you created.

+
image:images/lab8.3-insights-template3.png[1000,1000]

. Click the rocket for the template you created. This will launch the job and run the playbook you selected from the dropdown.

+
image:images/lab8.3-insights-template4.png[1000,1000]

. If everything is successful you will see a status of Sucessful in he DETAILS pane, and the ansible-playbook run output on the right. You're looking for something like the screenshot above.

. Now navigate back to your Satellite UI at https://sat-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com and from the Satellite UI, click on *Red Hat Insights → Inventory* you will notice that *ic4.summit.example.com* has one less issue, since we resolved the kernel vulnerability that we created the Plan and playbook for.

+
image:images/lab8.2-afteransiblefix.png[1000,1000]

+
NOTE: Please note that when the execution if a playbook is completed, the Insights agent is also run as part of this Ansible playbook, so the latest state of the system is reporting into Insights automatically.

=== Lab 8.4 BONUS LAB: Automatically fix all the issues on client systems using Ansible Tower

In this lab exercise, we will attempt to fix all the issues on the client systems, *ic1.summit.example.com* and *ic4.summit.example.com*.

. From the Satellite UI, click on *Red Hat Insights → Inventory* so we can focus on systems *ic1.summit.example.com* and *ic4.summit.example.com*, please notice these two show numerous actions each to be resolved.
+
image:images/lab8.3-insightsinventory.png[1000,1000]

. In the inventory screen, select both systems and click on Actions, on the top left corner, and then select Create a new Plan / Playbook
+
image:images/lab8.3-createplan.png[1000,1000]

. This way, we are going to create an Ansible Playbook based plan to solve issues on those two specific systems (systems can also be grouped as per our convenience, from that very same menu).

. The Plan / Playbook Builder screens will appear. Please make sure to fill the boxes as follows as your screenshots may vary slightly:
* Plan name: <GUID> Insights Fix ALL
* Actions: all (do this by clicking on the box by the Action label at the top).
+
Your screen should look like:
+
image:images/lab8.3-screen.png[1000,1000]

. Then click on the *Save* button in the bottom right corner.

. As before, you are given the option to choose between different ways to solve your issues. In this lab, we’ve chosen to go for the ones that do not require a reboot, in order to save some time.
+
The plan description screen will appear.
+
You should see all the issues this plan is going to solve as well as the affected systems.
+
image:images/lab8.3-planner.png[1000,1000]

. Like in the previous exercise, we need to log into the Ansible Tower machine in order to create a job template for the new Insights Plan that we created. Don't forget to sync your Insights Planner Sync project before building the template.

. Part of this being the bonus and final lab is that you may have ample time to perform remediations on ic1.summit.example.com and ic4.summit.example.com. Try to remediate all vulnerabilities on these hosts. There are some that will not have Ansible playbook generation capability, so you may have to do those manually, but you can knock out a majority of the vulnerabilities with Insights Plans and Ansible Tower. Just repeat the steps to create plans, sync them, and create and run the remediation template.

Please note that when the execution is completed (this may take a while), the Insights agent is also run as part of the Ansible playbook, so the latest state of the system is reporting into Insights automatically.

NOTE: This step may take long time as there are many issues that require updates and reboots.
