== Lab 0: Setup steps

=== Logging into all the Red Hat Products
Letâ€™s log into the Red Hat Products that you will use in this lab so they are ready to use.

. In a separate tab open your web browser to The Red Hat Summit https://www.opentlc.com/guidgrabber/guidgrabber.cgi[Guid Grabber^] application.
. For *Lab Code* select *L1034 - Implementing Proactive Security and Compliance Automation*.

+
. Enter the activation key provided by the lab instructor.
. In your *Red Hat Summit Lab Information* webpage, take note of your assigned GUID. You will use this GUID to access your lab's systems.
+

+
. From this page, you will be able to access all of the Red Hat Products that you will use in this lab.  For each of the links on this page you can log into the UI with *admin* as the Username and *r3dh4t1!* as the Password
+
NOTE: You cannot use the Chrome web browser to access the Openstack Horizon UI since it will never accept the SSL certificate. The default web browser on your Summit lab laptop is Firefox, so this is not a problem for the lab.

. From this same page, copy the hostname of the *Workstation* system it should be workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com where GUID matches your environment's guid.
+

. Next, from the *Workstation* system, SSH into the Satellite server, *sat6.summit.example.com*, as *root*, and issue the following command: *katello-service restart* . This will restart the katello service and ensure that Satellite is ready to use for our lab.
+
[source, text]
[lab-user@workstation]$ sudo -i
[root@workstation]# ssh sat6.summit.example.com
[root@sat6]# katello-service restart

=== Turning on *some* of your VMs
. Before starting the lab steps, you will need to turn on *some* (NOT all) of your VMs. Log into CloudForms with *admin* as the Username and *r3dh4t1!* as the Password.

. On the left menus, navigate to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Virtual Machines.*
